Readme_DecisionTree:By: Yijia JinDependency:	import math	from collections import Counter	import csv	import sysFunction and inner class:ReadingInput: 	Input: filepath of train.csv or test.csv, here num always 1	(if num = 0 means reading dataset without labels)	Output: if num = 1 return (data, label)		  Else return data as listClass TreeNode: Data structure for decision tree	left: left child (TreeNode)	Right: right child (TreeNode)	Data: (data (list), label(list)) (tuple)	Question: [attribute_index (int), threshold (float)] (list)	Entropy: entropy of node (float) CalEntropy: calculate entropy of a set of label	Input: a list contains labels	Output: information entropySeparateData: not use DivideData: separate data set and label set by a threshold	Input: (data, label) (tuple), threshold value (float), attribute index (int)	Output: left data (tuple) which attribute of that index less than threshold, right data (tuple) which attribute of that index more than or equal than that threshold valueBuildingTree: building entire decision tree by data and node using recursion	Input: data (tuple), current node (TreeNode)	Output: tree root (TreeNode)Classify: using decision tree to classify a single data point	Input: observe (data point), tree (TreeNode)	Output: predict label of that pointprintTree: not useprintNode: print a single node of the treeprintNodes: print the whole tree calAccuracy: calculate accuracy of prediction and true label	Input: prediction (list), ground truth (list)	Output: accuracy (float)ConfusionMatrix: print confusion matrix of the resultcrossValidation: 10-folder cross validation of data set 	Input: training data (tuple), test data (not used)	Output: best tree root of cross validationMain(): entire process of decision tree classifying and evaluation1. Building the tree, using train data and cross validation to find the best one2. classify each data point in test data3. print the tree and calculate accuracy, confusion matrixHow to Run: main()
